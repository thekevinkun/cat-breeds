                    somewhere on the coast of the Indian Ocean. This breed retains many hallmarks of 
                    the appearance of felis lybica, a wildcat that contributed its DNA to all 
                    domestic cats in existence today. Abyssinian cats were first recognized by England's 
                    Governing Council of the Cat Fancy in 1929. America's first Abyssinian cat 
                    litter was born in 1935. The breed is recognized by the Cat Fanciers' 
                    Association and The International Cat Association.`,

      existence: `Cat fanciers began experimenting with Asian Leopard cat hybridization 
                    more than 200 years ago, but the Bengal cat we know and love today didn’t 
                    emerge until the 1960s, when Dr. Willard Centerwall of Loma Linda University 
                    began hybridizing Asian Leopard cats to see whether they would pass their 
                    immunity to feline leukemia on to hybrid offspring. 
                    While immunity wasn’t passed on, something great did result from 
                    those early experiments: the beginnings of a future new cat breed. 
                    It took decades for Bengal cats to become standardized. In 1980, 
                    Dr. Centerwall sent some of his Bengal cats to Jean Mill, 
                    who wanted to decrease the desire for fur as a fashion statement 
                    by popularizing domestic cats with exotic looks. At the same time, 
                    she hoped to reduce the demand for illegal trafficking in wild cats 
                    for the pet industry.`,

      existence: `The history of the British Shorthair cat is a fascinating one. 
                    This ancient breed is believed to date back to the first century A.D. 
                    when the Romans invaded Britain, they brought cats with them. 
                    These early domesticated cats were tasked with the important 
                    job of keeping Roman camps clear of mice and other pests. 
                    The Romans' cats bred with local wildcats and as time passed, 
                    the offspring developed a distinctive look. Contemporary British 
                    Shorthairs retain the appearance of their ancestors, which were 
                    large and robust, with dense, short coats that provided protection 
                    from the elements.`,

      existence: `The Burmese cat has an intriguing history. 
                The breed's story begins with a chocolate-colored cat named Wong Mau.
                Dr. Joseph Thompson of  San Francisco brought Wong Mau home with him after 
                a trip to Burma in 1930. Wong Mau was small with a more compact body than 
                that of the Siamese, with a shorter tail, a rounded head, short muzzle, 
                and round, widely spaced eyes. Burmese cats were first registered 
                by the Cat Fanciers' Association in 1936, and the breed gained 
                full recognition in 1957. Part of the reason for the delay was 
                that some Burmese breeders were crossing their cats with 
                Siamese —a practice that was ultimately prohibited. The outcrossings 
                resulted in the development of the Tonkinese cat, so it certainly 
                provided some benefits that cat fanciers can appreciate!`,

      existence: `As you might have guessed, the Maine Coon cat is a native 
                    of the state of Maine. Endemic to the United States of America, 
                    this breed probably originated in the 1850s, when long-haired 
                    cats were brought to America and mated with local short-haired cats. 
                    The result was a hearty, healthy, large cat with incredible hunting prowess; 
                    a heavy, shaggy coat; and a long, flowing tail. The breed was exhibited 
                    at cat shows throughout the late 19th century. 
                    Farmers who prized these cats for their outstanding ability to 
                    keep barns and outbuildings free from rodents held their own competition, 
                    called the Maine State Champion Coon Cat contest at the Skowhegan Fair.`,

      existence: `The Oriental story began in England in the 1950s. There, many cat breeds 
                were brought to near extinction during the second world war when food shortages 
                and constant bombardment placed a massive strain on society as a whole. 
                As breeders worked to rebuild their foundations, new colors and patterns emerged. 
                The Oriental Shorthair and the Oriental Longhair have similar backgrounds: 
                Both have Siamese heritage along with Russian Blue, Abyssinian, 
                British Shorthair, and various domestic genetics that ultimately enlarged 
                and improved the Siamese gene pool. After all, color is the only thing that 
                distinguishes an Oriental from a contemporary Siamese cat.`,

                watching for another breeder. The kitten, born in 1986, was named Miracle, 
                but soon after, was re-named “Savannah.” 
                In 1989, Savannah bred with a Turkish Angora cat. She had three F2 kittens; 
                two lived, and one was stillborn. Savannah subsequently changed hands, 
                finding herself with a breeder named Lori Buchko. Two of her kittens from 
                later breedings were sold to Patrick Kelley, who had seen pictures of Savannah 
                in a 1986 copy of the Long Island Ocelot Club newsletter.`,

                Feline geneticists believe that the Sphynx we know today might share 
                some similarities with Aztec or Mexican hairless cats, which were last 
                documented in the early 1900s. The Sphynx cat breed as we know it 
                today got its start in 1966, when a black and white cat gave birth 
                to a hairless kitten named Prune in Ontario, Canada. After reaching maturity, 
                Prune was mated to other cats, resulting in kittens with hair as well 
                as hairless kittens. These cats, along with a few other hairless cats 
                born in, were used as the foundation for a new breed that was originally 
                called the Canadian Hairless Cat.`,

      existence: `The Turkish Angora cat evolved naturally in the mountains of Turkey 
                many hundreds of years ago. The earliest written records of the breed trace 
                back to France in the 1500s. Long-haired cats made their way to Britain and 
                France as early as the late 1500s, coming from Russia, Persia, and Turkey. 
                It's likely that some of these were Turkish Angoras. In the early 20th century, 
                European cat fanciers and breeders bred Angora cats to other 
                long-haired breeds, including Persians. Before long, 
                so much interbreeding had taken place that purebred Turkish 
                Angora cats nearly became extinct. The cats were impossible 
                to find outside of Turkey, where the breed is considered to be a national treasure.`,
