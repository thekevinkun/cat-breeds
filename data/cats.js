        `Abyssinians are one of the oldest cat breeds in existence. 
        The most recent genetic research suggests the breed originated in Southeast Asia, 
        somewhere on the coast of the Indian Ocean. This breed retains many hallmarks of the 
        appearance of felis lybica, a wildcat that contributed its DNA to all domestic cats in 
        existence today.`,
        `The modern Abyssinian cat is somewhat different than the original Abyssinian cat. 
        Many of today's Abyssinian lines were created with Russian Blues, Burmese, and Siamese 
        cats as foundation stock.`,
        `Abyssinian cats were first recognized by England's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy in 1929. 
        America's first Abyssinian cat litter was born in 1935. The breed is recognized by the Cat 
        Fanciers' Association and The International Cat Association.`

        `Cat fanciers began experimenting with Asian Leopard cat hybridization more than 200 years ago, 
        but the Bengal cat we know and love today didn’t emerge until the 1960s, when Dr. Willard 
        Centerwall of Loma Linda University began hybridizing Asian Leopard cats to see whether 
        they would pass their immunity to feline leukemia on to hybrid offspring. 
        While immunity wasn’t passed on, something great did result from those early experiments: 
        the beginnings of a future new cat breed.`,
        `It took decades for Bengal cats to become standardized. In 1980, Dr. Centerwall sent some 
        of his Bengal cats to Jean Mill, who wanted to decrease the desire for fur as a fashion statement 
        by popularizing domestic cats with exotic looks. At the same time, she hoped to reduce the demand 
        for illegal trafficking in wild cats for the pet industry.`,
        `The breed was further developed with the addition of Tory of Delhi, a domestic street 
        cat that was imported from India. Other breeders discovered that Egyptian Mau cats were 
        excellent candidates for pairing with Asian Leopard cats, with the cross resulting in beautiful 
        spotted Bengals.`

        `The history of the British Shorthair cat is a fascinating one. This ancient breed 
        is believed to date back to the first century A.D. when the Romans invaded Britain, 
        they brought cats with them. These early domesticated cats were tasked with the 
        important job of keeping Roman camps clear of mice and other pests.`,
        `The Romans' cats bred with local wildcats and as time passed, the offspring developed a 
        distinctive look. Contemporary British Shorthairs retain the appearance of their ancestors, 
        which were large and robust, with dense, short coats that provided protection from the elements.`,
        `Incredibly, the British Shorthair cat nearly became extinct during the first world war and 
        along with many other breeds, was nearly wiped out again by the end of the second world war.`,
        `In an effort to save Britain's favorite cat, British Shorthair breeders introduced Persians 
        to their bloodlines, ultimately creating British Longhair cats. Shorthaired offspring were 
        also bred with Russian Blue cats and French Chartreux cats in an effort to emphasize desirable 
        blue-grey coloring.`

        `The Burmese cat has an intriguing history. The breed's story begins with a chocolate-colored 
        cat named Wong Mau.`,
        `Dr. Joseph Thompson of  San Francisco brought Wong Mau home with him after a trip to Burma in 1930. 
        Wong Mau was small with a more compact body than that of the Siamese, with a shorter tail, 
        a rounded head, short muzzle, and round, widely spaced eyes.`,
        `Dr. Thompson also noted that the cat had darker brown points that accentuated her 
        sable coat. Curious to see what offspring would look like, he bred her to a Siamese cat. 
        The breeding produced a litter of kittens that included some with the appearance of Siamese 
        cats and others that looked like their mother.`,
        `Dr. Thompson then mated Wong Mau to one of her brown kittens. This time, the litter contained 
        three different kitten types: Some looked like Siamese cats, some resembled their mother, and 
        some were dark brown with no points. The sable colored cats without points were ultimately used 
        to create the foundation of the Burmese breed.`

        `As you might have guessed, the Maine Coon cat is a native of the state of Maine. 
        Endemic to the United States of America, this breed probably originated in the 1850s, 
        when long-haired cats were brought to America and mated with local short-haired cats. 
        The result was a hearty, healthy, large cat with incredible hunting prowess; a heavy, 
        shaggy coat; and a long, flowing tail.`,
        `The breed was exhibited at cat shows throughout the late 19th century. Farmers who 
        prized these cats for their outstanding ability to keep barns and outbuildings free 
        from rodents held their own competition, called the Maine State Champion Coon Cat 
        contest at the Skowhegan Fair.`,
        `Maine Coon cats fell out of fashion during the early 20th century, when more exotic 
        long-haired cat breeds such as Persians came to the United States. 
        The breed declined until the 1950s, with some people believing the Maine Coon 
        might have even become extinct.`,
        `Maine Coon cat aficionados Alta Smith and Ruby Dyer founded the Central Maine Cat Club 
        (CMCC) in 1953 to preserve the breed for future generations. In an effort to increase 
        awareness about the breed, the CMCC posted cat shows and exhibitions that featured 
        photographs of Maine Coon cats. The CMCC created the first written breed standards 
        for Maine Coon cats, helping this unique breed regain popularity.`

        `The Oriental story began in England in the 1950s. There, many cat breeds 
        were brought to near extinction during the second world war when food shortages 
        and constant bombardment placed a massive strain on society as a whole. As breeders 
        worked to rebuild their foundations, new colors and patterns emerged.`,

        Siamese heritage along with Russian Blue, Abyssinian, British Shorthair, and various 
        domestic genetics that ultimately enlarged and improved the Siamese gene pool. 
        After all, color is the only thing that distinguishes an Oriental from a contemporary Siamese cat.`,

        that resulted from various pairings. Thus, we’re graced with such breeds as the Havana Brown, 
        Foreigh White, and of course, the Oriental Bicolour. Over time, cat breed registries decided

        `The first Savannah cat was the result of an accidental breeding between a Siamese queen 
        owned by Judee Frank and a male serval that Frank was watching for another breeder. 
        The kitten, born in 1986, was named Miracle, but soon after, was re-named “Savannah.”`,
        `In 1989, Savannah bred with a Turkish Angora cat. She had three F2 kittens; two lived, 
        and one was stillborn. Savannah subsequently changed hands, finding herself with a breeder 
        named Lori Buchko. Two of her kittens from later breedings were sold to Patrick Kelley, 
        who had seen pictures of Savannah in a 1986 copy of the Long Island Ocelot Club newsletter.`,

        enthusiastic about the concept of the Savannah cat. Soon, though, word of the new hybrid 
        spread and in 1996, a small group of breeders including Kelley and Scroufe wrote and presented 
        the Savannah cat breed standard to The International Cat Association (TICA).`,

        hairless cats, which were last documented in the early 1900s.`,
        `The Sphynx cat breed as we know it today got its start in 1966, when a black and white cat 
        gave birth to a hairless kitten named Prune in Ontario, Canada. After reaching maturity, 
        Prune was mated to other cats, resulting in kittens with hair as well as hairless kittens. 
        These cats, along with a few other hairless cats born in, were used as the foundation for a 
        new breed that was originally called the Canadian Hairless Cat.`,
        `The breed had a very difficult start due to limited genetics. In the 1970s, breeders paired 
        the hairless cats born in separate litters in Toronto and Minnesota 
        (named Epidermis, Punkie, and Paloma) with Devon Rex cats, a breed with a very sparse hair coat. 
        People began calling the breed the Sphynx due to the hairless cats' resemblance to the ancient

        `The Turkish Angora cat evolved naturally in the mountains of Turkey many hundreds of years ago. 
        The earliest written records of the breed trace back to France in the 1500s. Long-haired cats 
        made their way to Britain and France as early as the late 1500s, coming from Russia, 
        Persia, and Turkey. It's likely that some of these were Turkish Angoras.`,
        `In the early 20th century, European cat fanciers and breeders bred Angora cats to other 
        long-haired breeds, including Persians. Before long, so much interbreeding had taken place 
        that purebred Turkish Angora cats nearly became extinct. The cats were impossible to find 
        outside of Turkey, where the breed is considered to be a national treasure.`,
        `In the early 1900s, Turkey's government and the Ankara Zoo developed a breeding program aimed 
        at preserving the Angora cat breed. White Angora cats with blue eyes, gold eyes, 
        or odd eyes (one blue eye and one eye in green, green-gold, or amber) were a main 
        focus of the breeding program.`,
        `In 1962, a U.S. Army colonel named Walter Grant was stationed in Turkey. He and his wife 
        exported a pair of Turkish Angora cats to the United States. These cats came with pedigrees 
        and interest in the breed grew rapidly. Even though it was difficult to import Angora cats, 
        more breeders joined the effort and these beautiful cats once again proliferated in the West.`
