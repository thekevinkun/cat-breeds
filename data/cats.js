        `Even though the American polydactyl cat isn’t a specific breed, these cats share 
        a unique genetic trait. Polydactyly is caused by a dominant gene that also causes 
        hyperdactyly (extra toes or digits) in other mammals – even humans can carry this gene!`,
        `There are different types of polydactyly in cats:`,
        `1. Preaxial polydactyly causes extra digits to form on the inside of the paw, causing 
        the cat to appear as if it’s wearing mittens.`, 
        `2. Postaxial polydactyly causes extra digits to form on the outer edges of the paw, 
        leading to nicknames such as snowshoe cat, patty paws, or pancake paws.`,
        `It's worth noting that Pixie Bob and Maine Coon polydactyl cats are in categories of their own. 
        At one time, an astonishing 40% of all Maine Coon cats had extra toes and it’s still quite 
        common for these kitties to exhibit the polydactyl trait. Some Maine Coon breeders even 
        select for it, as the Maine Coon Polydactyl is recognized by The International Cat Association

        `Cat fanciers began experimenting with Asian Leopard cat hybridization more than 200 years ago,

        Centerwall of Loma Linda University began hybridizing Asian Leopard cats to see whether 
        they would pass their immunity to feline leukemia on to hybrid offspring. 
        While immunity wasn’t passed on, something great did result from those early experiments: 
        the beginnings of a future new cat breed.`,
        `It took decades for Bengal cats to become standardized. In 1980, Dr. Centerwall sent some 
        of his Bengal cats to Jean Mill, who wanted to decrease the desire for fur as a fashion statement 
        by popularizing domestic cats with exotic looks. At the same time, she hoped to reduce the demand 
        for illegal trafficking in wild cats for the pet industry.`,
        `The breed was further developed with the addition of Tory of Delhi, a domestic street 
        cat that was imported from India. Other breeders discovered that Egyptian Mau cats were

        cats and others that looked like their mother.`,

        some were dark brown with no points. The sable colored cats without points were ultimately used

        `The Cornish Rex cat breed is the product of a natural genetic mutation. The breed got 
        its start in Cornwall, England, when a barn cat gave birth to an unusual kitten in 1950. 
        The kitten, later named Kallibunker (Kalli for short), had a short, curly, red-and-white coat. 
        His owner, Nina Ennismore, bred him back to his mother twice. Both of the resulting litters 
        contained curly-haired kittens.`,
        `Later, feline geneticists discovered that Rex cats are produced only when both parents have 
        the recessive gene. Other breeds were eventually introduced into the breeding program, 
        including Burmese, Siamese, and British Shorthair cats. Even though the resulting kittens 
        had short coats with normal hair, they all carried the recessive gene and subsequent breedings 
        typically produced kittens with the short, curly coats that make these cats so remarkable.`,
        `Cornish Rex cats were brought to the United States in 1957. The breed was granted official 
        recognition by the American Cat Fanciers' Association and the Canadian Cat Association in 1963. 
        The Cat Fanciers' Association gave the breed its stamp of approval in 1964. Today, the Cornish Rex

        The result was a hearty, healthy, large cat with incredible hunting prowess; a heavy, 
        shaggy coat; and a long, flowing tail.`,

        `With frequent travel came additional imports: both Persian and Angora cats made their way to 
        France and England. In England, they were called French cats and they quickly gained popularity 
        for their unique appearance and friendly personalities.`,
        `By the 1900s, Persian cats—then known as Persian Longhairs or simply as Longhairs—outpaced 
        Angoras in terms of popularity, perhaps because Queen Victoria had two blue Persians and people 
        of the day were heavily influenced by the Queen's personal tastes.`,
        `Today, Persians are renowned as North America’s most popular cat breed. 
        The Persian is recognized by cat breed registries worldwide.`

        `The first Savannah cat was the result of an accidental breeding between a Siamese queen 
        owned by Judee Frank and a male serval that Frank was watching for another breeder. 
        The kitten, born in 1986, was named Miracle, but soon after, was re-named “Savannah.”`,
        `In 1989, Savannah bred with a Turkish Angora cat. She had three F2 kittens; two lived, 
        and one was stillborn. Savannah subsequently changed hands, finding herself with a breeder 
        named Lori Buchko. Two of her kittens from later breedings were sold to Patrick Kelley, 
        who had seen pictures of Savannah in a 1986 copy of the Long Island Ocelot Club newsletter.`,
        `Kelley joined forces with an exotic cat breeder named Joyce Scroufe, who wasn’t at first 
        enthusiastic about the concept of the Savannah cat. Soon, though, word of the new hybrid 
        spread and in 1996, a small group of breeders including Kelley and Scroufe wrote and presented 
        the Savannah cat breed standard to The International Cat Association (TICA).`,
        `Four years passed before TICA ended a moratorium on new breeds, and in 2001, 
        the Savannah was accepted for registration only. By October of 2001, the breed 
        advanced to exhibition only status, and soon, Savannah cats were impressing judges 
        at TICA cat shows across the United States.`

        `There are quite a few stories about the origins of the Sphynx cat. Feline geneticists 
        believe that the Sphynx we know today might share some similarities with Aztec or Mexican 
        hairless cats, which were last documented in the early 1900s.`,
        `The Sphynx cat breed as we know it today got its start in 1966, when a black and white cat 
        gave birth to a hairless kitten named Prune in Ontario, Canada. After reaching maturity, 
        Prune was mated to other cats, resulting in kittens with hair as well as hairless kittens. 
        These cats, along with a few other hairless cats born in, were used as the foundation for a 
        new breed that was originally called the Canadian Hairless Cat.`,
        `The breed had a very difficult start due to limited genetics. In the 1970s, breeders paired 
        the hairless cats born in separate litters in Toronto and Minnesota 
        (named Epidermis, Punkie, and Paloma) with Devon Rex cats, a breed with a very sparse hair coat. 
        People began calling the breed the Sphynx due to the hairless cats' resemblance to the ancient 
        Egyptian Sphinx figure.`,
        `To maintain genetic diversity, The International Cat Association (TICA) breed standard 
        allows outcrossing to the American Shorthair and Devon Rex.`

        `The Turkish Angora cat evolved naturally in the mountains of Turkey many hundreds of years ago. 
        The earliest written records of the breed trace back to France in the 1500s. Long-haired cats 
        made their way to Britain and France as early as the late 1500s, coming from Russia, 
        Persia, and Turkey. It's likely that some of these were Turkish Angoras.`,
        `In the early 20th century, European cat fanciers and breeders bred Angora cats to other 
        long-haired breeds, including Persians. Before long, so much interbreeding had taken place 
        that purebred Turkish Angora cats nearly became extinct. The cats were impossible to find 
        outside of Turkey, where the breed is considered to be a national treasure.`,
        `In the early 1900s, Turkey's government and the Ankara Zoo developed a breeding program aimed 
        at preserving the Angora cat breed. White Angora cats with blue eyes, gold eyes, 
        or odd eyes (one blue eye and one eye in green, green-gold, or amber) were a main 
        focus of the breeding program.`,
        `In 1962, a U.S. Army colonel named Walter Grant was stationed in Turkey. He and his wife 
        exported a pair of Turkish Angora cats to the United States. These cats came with pedigrees 
        and interest in the breed grew rapidly. Even though it was difficult to import Angora cats, 
        more breeders joined the effort and these beautiful cats once again proliferated in the West.`
